Behavioral design patterns are a category of design patterns that deal with how objects interact and communicate with each other
to accomplish tasks. These patterns focus on defining algorithms and patterns of communication between objects to achieve specific
behaviors and functionalities. Behavioral design patterns help in making the system more flexible, reusable, and maintainable by promoting
loose coupling between objects and separating responsibilities effectively.

Here are some common behavioral design patterns:

Observer Pattern: This pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Strategy Pattern: The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

Command Pattern: The command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of requests.

Chain of Responsibility Pattern: In this pattern, a request is passed along a chain of handlers, with each handler deciding either to process the request or pass it on to the next handler in the chain.

Iterator Pattern: The iterator pattern provides a way to access the elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

State Pattern: The state pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

Template Method Pattern: This pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure.

Visitor Pattern: The visitor pattern defines a new operation to a set of objects without changing their classes. It is useful when you have to perform operations on a group of related objects without changing their structures.

Interpreter Pattern: This pattern is used to define a grammar for interpreting sentences in a language and provides an interpreter to interpret sentences as per the defined grammar.

Memento Pattern: The memento pattern captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.

Each behavioral pattern addresses specific aspects of object interaction and behavior, providing solutions to common design problems related to communication, encapsulation, and flexibility in software systems.
