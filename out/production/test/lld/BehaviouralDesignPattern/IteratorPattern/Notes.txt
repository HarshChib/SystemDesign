The Iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of a collection sequentially without
exposing its underlying representation. It defines a separate object, called an iterator, that encapsulates the traversal of a collection,
allowing clients to iterate over the collection's elements without needing to know its internal structure.
