In simple words, the Command pattern helps in organizing code by representing actions as objects. It promotes flexibility,
extensibility, and separation of concerns by keeping the sender separate from the receiver and allowing for easy addition of
new actions without changing existing code. It's especially useful when dealing with operations that need to be queued, logged,
or undone.
